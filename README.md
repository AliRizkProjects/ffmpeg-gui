# FFmpegGUI for video compression
Before using this GUI, ensure you have FFmpeg installed and correctly set in your system's PATH environment variable.
Currently it's entire purpose is just to make the compression process easier and more user friendly (for people not used to using the commandline)

This is my first ever Project :)
